# Mortgage deliquency rate and Unemployment Rate in the US

## Problem Statement
1. Problem Statement: To investigate the relationship between the mortgage deliquency rate in single households and the unemployment rate (focused on Black or African Americans)
2. Hypothesis: An increase in unemployment rate in the Black community is most likely to lead to an increase in mortgage deliquency rate in single households. 
3. Introduction: The cyclical nature of unemployment within a business cycle has a significant impact on mortgage payments, particularly in times of economic downturns. Notably, during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, an increase in mortgage defaults was observed, especially among borrowers with high loan-to-value ratios, predominately in minority groups (especially, Blacks and Hispanics groups). The mortgage delinquency rate surged to a record-high at 14.4 per cent. Furthermore, as the Mortgage Bankers Association reported, the delinquency rate was up to 8.22% in the second quarter of 2020. This study aims to investigate the relationship between unemployment rates and high mortgage delinquency rates.

1. There is a correlation between unemployment in the Black community and mortgage deliquency rate in single households.

3. During the Covid Pandemic, the mortgage deliquency rate has a smaller percentage icnreaase due to forbearance scheme, despite having  very high levels of unemployment.

## Future investigations
1. Perform some predictive models, using a time series forecasting and regression analysis
2. Advise solutions based on data analysis results, and scholar journals and articles
